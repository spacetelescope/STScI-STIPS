.. note::

  As of version 2.0, STIPS no longer offers support for HST or JWST.

Overview
--------
STIPS is the Space Telescope Imaging Product Simulator. It is designed to create
simulations of full-detector post-pipeline astronomical scenes for the Nancy Grace Roman
Space Telescope's Wide-Field Instrument (WFI). STIPS has the ability to add
instrumental distortion (if available) as well as calibration residuals from flatfields,
dark currents, and cosmic rays. It automatically includes Poisson noise and readout noise.
It does not include instrument saturation effects.

Why use STIPS?
--------------
STIPS is intended to produce quick simulations that are corrected for distoriton, but not mosaicked.
We note there is no equivalent flight product, since Roman Level 3 (L3) files are both distortion
corrected and mosaicked, while Level 2 (L2) files are neither. STIPS is ideal for
cases where `Pandeia <https://pypi.org/project/pandeia.engine/>`_ does not
provide a large enough simulation area (e.g., full-detector or multiple-detector
observations). STIPS obtains its Roman instrument and filter values from
Pandeia, so it should produce output within 10% of output produced by Pandeia.

STIPS does not start with Level 1 (L1) images and propagate instrumental calibrations
through the simulations. While it does have the ability to add error residuals (representing
the remaining uncertainty after pipeline calibration), these residuals are not validated
against actual pipeline calibrations of L1 images. STIPS is not the ideal choice if
extremely good instrumental accuracy is needed. Pandeia is the preferred tool for
high-accuracy observations.
