# This file describes a conda environment that can be used to install STIPS for development and
# testing purposes. Note that this environment setup installs the STIPS module in
# editable mode, so any changes you make to the STIPS source will be reflected the next
# time you run python.
#
# Run the following command to set up this environment:
# $ conda env create -f environment.yml
#
# The environment name can be overridden with the following command:
# $ conda env create -n <custom name> -f environment.yml
#
# Run the following command to activate the environment:
# $ conda activate stips_dev
#
# To deactivate the environment run the following command:
# $ conda deactivate
#
# To remove the environment entirely, run the following command:
# $ conda env remove -n stips

    # poppy 1.0.3 fixes a bug with the way poppy was calling factorial with non-integer
    # values. Currently this is the only way to ensure that webbpsf picks up the correct
    # poppy version. This peg should be removed as soon as webbpsf has updated to only
    # use poppy versions that include this fix.
